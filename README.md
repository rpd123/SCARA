# SCARA  
  
Arduino code is in the robotArm folder.  
Python code is at https://github.com/rpd123/chess-robot  
  
It uses a mini gripper:

manipulator.stl is not required
   
This is for a modified version of pyBot. See original at:  
https://www.jjrobots.com/scara-robotic-arm-assembly-guide/  
  
We have the pyBot stlfiles here. The change from the original is to have a longer shank1 top piece and a replaced shank2 (as well as a different gripper).  
Shank2 is to be screwed into the bottom of the end cylinder of shank1.  
    
You will need to drill some holes.    
Also the cylinder has a screw right through from top to bottom, and  locknut on the end.  
    
The longer shank1 requires a 400mm belt.  
    
Note: this modification is for playing chess, where the load is very light.  
This modification allows shank2 to turn right back against shank1, and so allows the robot to stand next to the chessboard and reach near and far squares.
